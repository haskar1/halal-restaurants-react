when location is searched:
  if there are no restaurants within 50 mile radius, 
  zoom out to 50 mile radius (searched location's coordinates in the middle) 
  and display message saying no restaurants found

  if there is one restaurant within 50 mile radius,
  zoom out only enough to show the one restaurant with padding around
  keep center as searched location's coordinates 

  if there are two or more restaurants within 50 mile radius,
  zoom out and use the outer most restaurant as the edge for map bounds
  only zoom out to show enough padding 
  (i.e. if the outer most restaurant is only 20 miles from center then zoom to that and add padding)
  keep center as searched location's coordinates 

  display distance to restaurants from searched center 



allow zooming while mouse hovered over popup
